Throughout the development of the LitraLand system, the team encountered several challenges—both technical and conceptual—that tested our problem-solving skills and ability to adapt. These challenges were essential learning moments that contributed to improving the quality of the final product.



#### 1. **Integrating Dual Modules: Library and Community**

One of the biggest challenges was designing a unified platform that could support both a structured physical library management system and a flexible community-driven book-sharing area. Balancing strict data validation for the library with the user-generated content of the community required careful architectural decisions and custom role-based permissions.



#### 2. **Implementing External Authentication**

Setting up secure external login mechanisms using Google and Facebook involved navigating OAuth 2.0 protocols, handling callback exceptions (such as user cancellations), and ensuring consistent user data retrieval. Additionally, automatically confirming email addresses from trusted providers without compromising security required careful handling.



#### 3. **Real-Time Book Loading with Search and Filters**

Developing the Community Book section with infinite scrolling, dynamic filtering, and real-time search introduced front-end and back-end complexities. Ensuring performance and responsiveness required optimizing database queries, implementing pagination properly, and managing client-side loading states with AJAX.



#### 4. **Role Management and Access Control**

Managing different user roles such as Library Admin, Community Admin, Staff, and Members required fine-grained access control. Mistakes in role assignments could lead to data exposure or unauthorized actions, so we had to implement and test role-based authorization carefully using ASP.NET Identity.



#### 5. **UI/UX Consistency Across Areas**

Designing two areas (Library and Community) within the same system without causing user confusion was a significant challenge. Each area had its own workflows and priorities, so maintaining consistent visual identity and navigation while serving different user needs demanded thoughtful UI decisions.



#### 6. **Testing Asynchronous Features**

Automated email notifications, background jobs (via Hangfire), and multi-user scenarios introduced difficulties during testing. Ensuring that asynchronous features triggered correctly and didn’t conflict with user actions (like renting a book or registering) required extensive testing and debugging.



#### 7. **Data Privacy and Security**

Handling user data securely—especially in the community area where books and profiles are publicly visible—was a core priority. Obfuscating user/book IDs with Hashids and limiting data exposure via DTOs helped protect sensitive information from being misused.



These challenges not only shaped the project but also strengthened our understanding of real-world software development and web application architecture. Each obstacle taught us how to build more robust, secure, and user-centered systems.
