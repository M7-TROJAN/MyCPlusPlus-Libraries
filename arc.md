جميل جدًا، نبدأ بـ **Chapter 18: Technologies Used** — وده فصل بيعرض كل التقنيات اللي استخدمناها في بناء مشروع **LitraLand**، مع توضيح دور كل تقنية وليه اخترناها. لازم نكتب الكلام بشكل واضح ومهني.

### **18. Technologies Used**

The development of *LitraLand* involved a combination of modern technologies and tools to ensure scalability, performance, security, and ease of use. Below is an overview of the main technologies used in the system:

---

#### **1. ASP.NET Core MVC**

* **Purpose:** Backend development and server-side rendering.
* **Why Used:** ASP.NET Core MVC is a robust and modern web framework that supports clean separation of concerns, strong routing, and integrated dependency injection. It allowed us to build scalable and maintainable web applications with high performance.

#### **2. Entity Framework Core**

* **Purpose:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to handle database interactions.
* **Why Used:** EF Core simplifies database access by allowing developers to interact with the database using C# objects, instead of raw SQL. It also supports code-first and migration-based workflows, which helped us manage and evolve the database schema easily.

#### **3. Microsoft SQL Server**

* **Purpose:** Primary relational database.
* **Why Used:** SQL Server is reliable, scalable, and well-integrated with EF Core. It provides advanced querying capabilities, performance optimization tools, and strong support for transactions and indexing.

#### **4. Identity Framework**

* **Purpose:** User authentication and authorization.
* **Why Used:** ASP.NET Identity enabled us to manage user accounts, roles, password hashing, and security features such as two-factor authentication, all within a flexible system.

#### **5. Bootstrap**

* **Purpose:** Frontend styling and responsive layout.
* **Why Used:** Bootstrap provided a fast and responsive UI with ready-made components like forms, buttons, modals, and navigation bars. It ensured the application looks good on all screen sizes.

#### **6. JavaScript & AJAX**

* **Purpose:** Enhancing interactivity and dynamic loading of content (e.g., book filtering and infinite scroll).
* **Why Used:** JavaScript and AJAX were used to make the user experience more fluid and responsive, especially in the Community area for filtering, searching, and loading books without page reloads.

#### **7. Google & Facebook Authentication**

* **Purpose:** External login integration.
* **Why Used:** To make registration and login easier for users, we implemented Google and Facebook login using OAuth2. This improved user experience and reduced friction in onboarding.

#### **8. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**

* **Purpose:** Querying collections and database entities.
* **Why Used:** LINQ provided a concise, readable, and powerful way to query data, especially when filtering books or generating statistics in the Community module.

#### **9. Hangfire**
  A background job processing library used to schedule tasks like sending emails and cleanup operations without affecting the user experience.

#### **10. Hashids**
  A library used to obfuscate database IDs in URLs, enhancing security and preventing users from easily guessing record identifiers.

#### **11. SweetAlert2**

* **Purpose:** Displaying custom popup alerts for user actions.
* **Why Used:** For better user feedback and interface consistency, SweetAlert2 was used for confirmation messages, success notifications, and error alerts.

#### **12. Git & GitHub**

* **Purpose:** Version control and collaboration.
* **Why Used:** Git helped track code changes and collaborate effectively. GitHub was used to host the project repository, manage issues, and maintain version history.
